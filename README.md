# Github-Web-Scrapping-Project-


GitHub Web Scraping Project
This project focuses on scraping GitHub topics, including their titles, descriptions, and URLs, using BeautifulSoup and requests libraries in Python. The extracted data is then stored into a CSV file for future data visualization and analysis.

Introduction
GitHub is a platform widely used by developers for version control, collaboration, and sharing of code repositories. Understanding trending topics on GitHub can provide valuable insights into emerging technologies, popular programming languages, and community interests. By scraping GitHub topics and storing the data in a structured format, we enable further analysis and visualization.

Tools Used
Python: Programming language used for web scraping and data manipulation.
BeautifulSoup: Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
requests: Python library for making HTTP requests.
pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
Project Workflow
Scraping GitHub Topics: We use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the GitHub topics page. The relevant information, including topic titles, descriptions, and URLs, is extracted and stored in a pandas DataFrame.

Storing Data in CSV Format: The extracted data is then saved into a CSV file named github_topics.csv. This CSV file serves as a structured data source for future analysis and visualization tasks.

Usage
To run the project:

Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the web scraping code.

Execute the code to scrape GitHub topics and store the data into a CSV file.

 Future Use the generated github_topics.csv file for data visualization, analysis, or any further processing as needed.
